# Laravel-CRUD-App

This is a simple CRUD blog using Laravel based on the great series by Traversy Media on youtube. This app uses Laravel alongside simple HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap.

You can find his playlist on youtube: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbYhQsN5WMXy6VsDMKGadrJ-&si=zGtCaEqX6_JdvWP8

There is also an updated tutorial for 2022: https://youtu.be/MYyJ4PuL4pY?si=641GncGY7F3FtPlw

To run this you must install Laravel. I recommend using Composer to manage PHP packages: https://getcomposer.org/

I also recommend you run this through XAMPP for it was what I used: https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/index.html

Remember to create a blank mySQL table and to run the command to run migrations. Also some setup is necessary regarding the virtual hosts to run this properly. Traversy's tutorial covers all of this on part 2.
